${\textsf{\color{magenta}FashionSwap}}$ is an innovative AI project that focuses on the transformation of clothing styles. Using a dataset of individuals wearing different clothing items, the system segments or detects the clothing item, crops it, transfers its style through a GAN, and finally fits it back onto the individual. This way, we can visualize how a transformed clothing style would look on a person.
